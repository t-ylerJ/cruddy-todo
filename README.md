# cruddy-todo
cruddy-todo is an application that serves as a to-do list. It uses CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to keep track of tasks and remove them from the list once completed.
I completed this project with another engineer during my time as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).
